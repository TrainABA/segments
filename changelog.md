1.0.0
This version is barebones, emphasizing stability. More features available with next release.

Release v1.0,0 contains meeting agendas only. Both group and individual meeting agendas are included. Each is organized by segment and matches the TrainABA book (minor errata fixed). These Assignments allow supervisors to easily manage via Moodle Calendar for sending out announcements/info pre-meeting. It uses the messaging system from Moodle to share feedback, updates, etc. as desired.

These materials cover all of the 4th ed. task list. You can start your 1500 hours of independent fieldwork (or practicum, intensive or whatever) at hour 1 with this Moodle course and follow it all the way to the end. For release 1, you will need to use the books to get the rest of the material. More development will follow, particularly as TrainABA sysadmin can analyze how these materials are being used.

No warranty, no implied or guaranteed merchantability, no BACB affiliation, no liability for anything happening as a result of using this software.

This is modular. You can select which agendas to include/exclude at the time of restoring it into a course. It is a good idea to set up a grading scale to make feedback easier. Don't bother setting up competencies, as that will be included in next year's release.
