Examples:
Twelve strangers walk by an elderly man. He greets three of them and ignores the rest. The percent of occurrence of greeting strangers is 25%.
To compute: Divide number of greetings emitted by the man (3) by the total number of opportunities to greet (12) and multiply that product by 100 to yield a percentage (3/12= 0.25 x 100= 25%).

Non-Examples:
Twelve strangers walk by an elderly man. He greets three of them and ignores the rest. The percent of occurrence of greeting strangers is 0.25.
