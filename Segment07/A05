Example: 
Sparky loves to bark at passing cars.  He hears a car drive by the house and barks.  Thirty-seven seconds later another car passes by and Sparky barks again.  Interresponse time between barking at the vehicles is thirty-seven seconds.
Doodles the cat likes to scratch the furniture.  She walks over the chair and sinks her claws in.  Eleven seconds later Doodles walks over to the couch and begins to scratch again.  Interresponse time between scratches is eleven seconds.  
Roger the rooster doesn’t know that he’s only supposed to crow at dawn. He lets out crows all day long.  He is observed to crow at 3:43 in the afternoon.  He crows again at 3: 59.  Interresponse time between crows is sixteen minutes.  

Non-Example:
Sparky’s owner accidentally steps on his tail.  Sparky yelps from the pain.
