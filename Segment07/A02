Alternatively, rate is not always defined synonymously with frequency throughout the discipline of behavior analysis. Catania (2013) defines rate as “responses per unit time but frequency as “total responses over a fixed time, over a session of variable duration or, in trial procedure, over a fixed number of trials.” Cooper, Heron, & Heward (2007) functionally defines “count” whereas Catania defines “frequency”.

Examples:
A young child is sitting at a table where there is a bag of potato chips. They eat 8 chips, stand up, and walk to the living room to watch TV for the rest of the hour. Rate of chip eating is 8 per hour.
Child is playing basketball for 30 minutes. Dribbles 7 times and then practices foul shots. He shoots 15 times and between each shot he dribbles 3 times. Frequency of dribbling is 52 dribbles per 30 minutes.
