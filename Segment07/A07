Example: 
A behavioral interventionist is teaching a child how to brush her teeth. She teaches this using a task analysis that involves backwards chaining. She provides two opportunities per session for the child to complete this skill. Data reflect that it takes the child on average four opportunities before she is able to complete the step being taught independently and to move to the next step in the task analysis.
