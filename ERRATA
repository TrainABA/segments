2017-05-30 Is E-11 part of Segment 5, it's not listed on the scorecard or meeting agendas. Yes. The Independent Fieldwork book has E-11 face sheet in the Segment 5 section, but lists it in Segment 6. Going forward, E-11 will live in Segment 5 for a future book printing. 

SEGMENT 13- B06 not listed in scorecard or agendas but it is included as a facesheet. Is this where it should be? If so, add to seg. 13 scorecard & agendas.
