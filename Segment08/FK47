Example: 
“I want a cookie” (mand for an item; can also include verbs, use of adjectives, prepositions, pronouns etc.)
A child says “watch me” after learning how to ride a bike independently (mand for attention)
Asking questions like “what’s your name?” or “where’s the phone?” (mand for information)
