Example: 
(CMO-R) A child engages in escape-maintained problem behavior during matching to sample instruction. In time, the child engages in escape-maintained problem behavior when the materials for matching to sample are brought out, before instruction has begun. 

(CMO-T) You walk up to your front door and turn the knob, but the door is locked. You reach into your pocket and grab your keys and unlock the door. 

(CMO-S) In the presence of a stimulus that has been paired with a cold environment, the value of stimuli that produce warmth increases.
