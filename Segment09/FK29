Example: 
A child often asks their parents to play video games after school. The child’s father often says “yes” to this request, while the child’s mother says “no” and tells the child to get started on their homework. Over time the child continues to ask their father if they can play video games, but has stopped asking their mother. In this example the presence of the father likely functions as an SD due to the history of requests being granted in his presence, but not in the presence of their mother.

After playing outside for an hour, a child walks into the house and gets a drink of water. In this example, playing outside likely functions as a motivating operation, more specifically as establishing operation, in that it increases the value of water as a reinforce and increases the frequency of behavior with a history of producing water.

A student earns tokens throughout the school day and can trade them in for a preferred item or activity. Usually the student chooses to trade in their tokens for a small snack, accept after lunch. Usually after lunch the student chooses computer over snacks. In this example, consuming food during lunch likely functions as a motivating operation, more specifically an abolishing operation, in that it decreases the value of food as a reinforcer and decreases the frequency of behavior with a history of producing food.
