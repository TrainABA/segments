<hr><h5>Planning</h5>

<p><i>Over-communicate these procedures to new supervision group members.</i></p>

<ul><li><i>Location</i>:</li>
	<li><i>Time of meeting</i>:</li>
	<li><i>Materials needed for the room</i>: Power supply, water, enough room for role play, chairs, copies of supervised experience forms, whiteboard, markers, lighting, a/v equipment, broadband connection if attendee(s) use web chat.</li>
	<li><i>Materials supervisor needs</i>: Moodle access, notes, comfortable shoes.</li>
	<li><i>Materials learners need</i>: Laptop with browser, smartphone (to install Moodle app). For areas without wifi, use Moodle Desktop app.</li>
	<li><i>What to do if you are running late</i>:</li>
	<li><i>What to do if you must cancel</i>:</li>
	<li><i>This is a facilitated meeting. Learner participation is essential. Arrive ready to interact.</i></li>
</ul><hr><h5>Opening</h5>

<p><i><b>5 minutes</b>. Supervisor completes the following steps to open the meeting.</i></p>

<ul><li>Greet attendees.</li>
	<li>Optional: Run warm-up game of your choice.<br></li>
	<li>Take attendance.</li>
	<li>State meeting duration.</li>
	<li>Distribute BACBÂ® supervised fieldwork forms to supervisees (or give instructions for paperless).</li>
</ul><hr><h5>Part I: Scenario

</h5><p><i><b>5 minutes. S</b></i><i><b>upervisor reads this section out loud, then moves to next activity.</b></i><i> Use/modify suggested group facilitation program below.</i></p>

<p>HR approaches your team with good news. All the technicians were accepted in a master's program! The company plans to assess the technicians, for placement in fieldwork supervision cohorts. HR needs your expertise, to create assessment criteria for each task list item in the current segment. You are being asked to brainstorm scenarios in this meeting, role play, and present your findings. Specifications are below.<br></p>

<ul><li>HR requests one scenario per task list item.</li>
	<li>Each scenario should be based on true events, depicting a fictional situation that could reasonably occur in service delivery.</li>
	<li>You will not be present when HR implements the assessment, which will be some time next year. HR shared the following procedure of how they plan to conduct the assessment, to help your cohort better understand how to write appropriate scenarios.</li>
	<li><u>Procedure:</u><em> The HR assessors, as a panel, will read a scripted scenario to a technician. Next, the assessors will ask three open-ended questions. <br></em></li></ul><ol><li><em>"What would you do next?"</em></li><li><em>"What would you expect to happen if that recommendation was successful?"</em></li><li><em>"What if it was unsuccessful?"</em></li></ol><ul><li>A perfectly designed scenario promotes successful service outcomes and illustrates competency in the task last item.
	</li><li>You will test the scenarios via role play interviews during this meeting.
</li><li><u>Deadline</u>: You have until the end of this meeting to finish the assignment.
       </li><li><u>Deliverable</u>: The HR manager expects two deliverables from each team: a 5-10 minute presentation and a two-column report.
		</li><li><u>Presentation</u><i>: </i>The presentation should be brief, including a demonstration (role play of the assessment), at the end of the meeting.
       		</li><li><u>Report</u><i>: </i>For the two-column report, the first column has the name of each task list item for this segment. The second column includes one scenario.

	<hr><h5>Part II: Knowledge</h5>

<p><i><b>30 minutes. Followed by 5 minute break.</b> Run through online Lesson content from the current segment.&nbsp; Focus on definitions, descriptions, and SAFMEDS. Supervisors, use below items and modify as needed.&nbsp;</i></p>

<ul><li><b>10 minutes</b>. <b>Learners divided </b><b>into pairs, supervisor walks around</b>. Look at the online Lesson content for each of task list item in this segment. Review the definitions and descriptions quickly. (If a learner has not previously studied the materials from Lessons or university work, do not let them slow down/interfere with the group.) What stands out as important for assessment, for the HR report you are organizing?</li>
	<li><b>5 minutes. Learners all together, supervisor facilitates</b> <b>with whiteboard/flip chart</b>. Group members collectively build a target list of questions to test whether the technician is demonstrating that knowledge.</li>
	<li><b>10 minutes. Learners divided into pairs, supervisor walks around</b>. Divide into pairs. Take turns role playing. One person role plays as supervisor, asking questions. Partner role plays as technician, answering questions.</li>
	<li><b>4 minutes. Learners all together, supervisor facilitates with whiteboard/flip chart</b>. Come back to main group. Decide collectively. Are these effective tests for whether a technician knows each task list item? Answer for each item in the segment task list.</li>
	<li><b>1 minute. Learners all together, supervisor at whiteboard/flip chart</b>. Supervisor quickly summarizes what was covered in the last 30 minutes of this exercise.</li>
</ul><br><b><i>Break</i></b>: Supervisor provides a 5-minute bio break. Extend to 10 minutes if facility has a line for the restroom, long hallway, or food/beverages arrive.<br><br>
Total time of all previous meeting activities is 45 minutes. Assuming a 90 minute supervision meeting (maximum time allowed), the meeting is at a halfway point.
<hr><h5>Part III: Skills</h5>

<p><i><b>35 minutes. Divide learners into two teams (cohort size permitting). Supervisor facilitates from whiteboard/flip chart or walking around room. </b>Supervisors: Run through online Lesson content for these items. Select items learners need to practice, as evidenced by what you see in their performance at client observation, online Lesson submissions, or other factors. Pull up lesson materials for examples. Ask questions, give challenges, and facilitate role play. Practice this section until time runs out. Field questions as asked but keep learners on task.</i></p>

<p><b>Instructions for Group Game</b></p>

<p>With the supervisor facilitating, divide into two groups (Team A and Team B, if cohort is large enough).</p>

<ol><li><b>15 minutes. Learners divided into two teams, supervisor walks around room. </b>Group members make final decisions about criteria for the HR report, preparing to give presentations. The facilitator walks around to assist.</li>
	<li><b>10 minutes. First group presents their assessment for HR. </b>Walk through each item on the two-column report, demonstrating how to assess each item listed.<b> </b></li>
	<li><b>10 minutes. Second group presents their assessment for HR. </b>Walk through each item on the two-column report, demonstrating how to assess each item listed.</li>
</ol><hr><h5>Closing</h5>

<p><i><b>10 minutes. Supervisor seated at front of the room, ready to facilitate closing discussion and sign forms (paper or digital).</b> </i></p>

<ul><li>Supervisor: Briskly review what the group accomplished in this meeting. Revisit Part I and re-read the questions. Did the group successfully deliver what HR requested (one scenario per segment task list item, tested via role play)?</li>
	<li>What stands out as the most challenging from this exercise? Are there any caveats we should include in the HR report?</li>
	<li>Supervisor: Invite learners to vocalize their learning experience in this meeting (up to 30 seconds per participant for large groups, 1 minute per person in small groups).</li>
	<li>Supervisor: Sign supervision forms at end of meeting unless you have a different process for signing forms.</li>
	<li>Congratulate attendees on finishing the meeting.</li>
	<li>State next steps for attendees to complete after this meeting (e.g., finish online lessons, turn in forms, schedule individual supervised meeting)<i>.</i></li>
