F-01 USE SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES.

Definition:
Self-management - “…behavior that a person emits to influence another behavior” (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007, p. 577).

Skinner (1953) first outlined the idea of self-management with his theories on self-control. He defined self-control as, “When a man controls himself, chooses a course of action, thinks out the solution to a problem, or strives towards an increase in self-knowledge, he is behaving. He controls himself precisely as he would control the behavior of anyone else- through the manipulation of variables of which behavior is a function” (pp. 228-229).
“All self-control- or self-management- tactics can be operationalized in terms of two behaviors: (a) the target behavior a person wants to change (Skinner’s controlled response) and (b) the self-management behavior (Skinner’s controlling response) emitted to control the target behavior” (Cooper et al., 2007, p. 577).
Applications include “helping a person be more effective and efficient in his daily life, replacing bad habits with good ones, accomplishing difficult tasks, and achieving personal goals” (Cooper et al., 2007, p. 579).

Example:
Skipping lunch (controlling behavior) to enjoy all three courses of your dinner (controlled behavior).
Leaving a bag of garbage near the front door (controlling behavior) to remind you to take it to the dumpster next time you leave the house (controlled behavior).
