Example:
Bob was trying to find the most reinforcing items for one of his students. He decided to conduct a preference assessment in which he used a timer to track the duration of engagement with various toys and games during recess time. He took the duration of engagement for each item and turned this into a reinforcer hierarchy. This helped his reinforcement program become an instant success.
