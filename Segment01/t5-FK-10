Example: 
Opening a door
Behavior: Beezus stands up from her chair, heads towards a closed door, and pushes on it.  The door is now open.  
Response: When encountering a closed door, Beezus extends an open palm and pushes on it.  The door is now open.   
Response Class: Beezus encounters many doors during her day.  Sometimes she opens them with an open palm and sometimes with a closed palm.  Sometimes she opens them with her left hand and at other times with her right hand.  No matter which way she chooses to open a door, the result is always the same.
