Example: 
Willis is shopping at the local mall. The local mall would be an environment.
Willis is walking through the food court.  He smells some pizza cooking from one of the establishments and suddenly his stomach starts growling.  He stops and gets some food.  All of the things in the food court, including the smells, the changes in his stomach, and the food are stimuli.
At the food court, Willis will buy items that will all function as reinforcers for eating behavior. In this case, the burger, the fries, and the cookie he bought are in the same stimulus class.
