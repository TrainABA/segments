Example: 
Rod conducted an FBA on Billy’s aggression and property destruction. Both behaviors were determined to be maintained by escape from demands. Rod decided to implement the same intervention for each behavior using a multiple baseline design because they both served the same function and a reversal would possibly reestablish the dangerous behavior after therapeutic effects were observed. 

Non-Example:
Bob wanted to determine the effects of response blocking and redirection on hand flapping with one of his students. He implemented this procedure and once it proved effective, decided to eliminate the intervention to determine if this procedure was the likely cause of the behavior decrease.
