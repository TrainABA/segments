K-06 PROVIDE SUPERVISION FOR BEHAVIOR CHANGE AGENTS.

Smith, Parker, Taubman, and Lovaas (1992) found that knowledge transfer from a staff training workshop did not generalize to the group home.  Research suggests that training is most effective if there is training and ongoing supervision in the environment where the behavior change program is occurring (Parsons & Reed, 1995; Sarokoff & Sturmey, 2004; Miles & Wilder, 2009) 
Codding, Feinberg, Dunn and Pace (2004) found that treatment integrity increased following a one hour performance feedback session every other week.  Social validity ratings provided favorable feedback for the frequent supervisions. 
Cooper, Heron and Heward (2007) suggest that supervision of data takers and booster training is necessary to avoid observer drift. 
Observing and graphing data will provide immediate feedback on the participant's performance.  This can lead to quick decisions, modifications if necessary, or the termination of ineffective programs.  This supervision is necessary to create the most effective interventions and troubleshoot areas for improvement. It is also important to observe the intervention in the natural environment in order to determine if the intervention is realistic and practical in the natural environment.

Summary of Rationale for Supervision of Behavior Change Agents
Provides effective knowledge transfer for individuals implementing the intervention
Increases motivation and treatment integrity
Reduces error associated with data collection
Allows for quick clinical decisions to modify or terminate programs which ensures the most effective treatment
