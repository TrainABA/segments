Examples:
John is conducting a functional analysis (FA) on aggression in one of his students. He has asked Mary to observe the behavior and record data simultaneously with him to calculate Interobserver agreement. He plans on conducting a 5-minute session with 30, 10-second intervals. He plans to use interval agreement IOA.  He records 4 instances of aggression during the FA in the 21st, 22nd, 23rd and 24th interval. Mary records 4 instances in the 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 25th interval. He calculates IOA to be 97% or 29/30 intervals.

Non-examples:
John is conducting a functional analysis on aggression in one of his students. He asks Mary to come in and observe but does not provide her with a data recording sheet to take data on the behavior. At the end of the session he asks Mary if she saw any aggression during the session.
