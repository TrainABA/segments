Examples:
Similar to classical conditioning, a tone (neutral stimulus) is repeatedly paired with an electric shock (unconditioned punisher) whenever a dog barks, in time the tone (conditioned punisher) suppresses the bark in the absence of the electric shock.

A child engages in aggression. A parent responds to aggression by taking away their childâ€™s favorite video game contingent on every instance of aggression.  The parent begins to pair removal of the video games with a reprimand.  The reprimand may function as a conditioned punisher if aggression continues to decrease following the presentation of a reprimand without taking away the video games.  This process illustrates conditioned punishment.
