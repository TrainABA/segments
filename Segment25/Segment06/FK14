Examples:
Pavlovâ€™s experiments consisted of a group of dogs who were trained to salivate at the sound of a metronome started just prior to feeding them. Before initial training, the presence of food (US) elicited salivation (UR), but the metronome (NS) was not paired with this response. After numerous trials of food being paired with the sound of the metronome, the dogs began salivating whenever they heard the metronome. After being paired with the presentation of food for several trials, the metronome became a conditioned stimulus (CS) and a conditioned reflex (CR) was elicited. 

Roger usually drinks soda every day for lunch. When drinking soda, the sugar (US) inside his blood elicits the release of insulin from his pancreas (UR). Now, when he opens the soda, the snap of the can (CS) starts to elicit the release of insulin (CR) before he takes a drink.
