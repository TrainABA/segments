Examples:
Hitting the snooze button or hitting the break:
Gertrude is not a “morning person.”  Her alarm goes off at precisely 5:30AM.  She hears the annoying wail but doesn’t respond immediately.  After 32 seconds of beeping, she whacks the snooze button, rolls over and goes back to sleep.  Latency to turning off the alarm is 32 seconds.
Marty is driving down a country road.  Out of nowhere a herd of deer dart out in front of his car.  It takes Marty 5 seconds from the time he first sees the deer to hit the break.  Latency from the time the deer are spotted to applying pressure to the break is 5 seconds.    
Gertrude is not a morning person.  Her alarm goes off at precisely 5:30 AM.  She does not respond to its annoying wailing and continues to sleep despite the noise.  The alarm stops on its own 1 hour later.

Related Lessons: 
H-01 Select a measurement system to obtain representative data given the dimensions of the behavior and the logistics of observing and recording.
I-01 Define the behavior in observable and measurable terms
FK-47 Identify the measurable dimensions of behavior (e.g., rate, duration, latency, interresponse time).
