FK-36 response generalization.

Definition (Response generalization): 


 



















(Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007). 
Flashcard created			Learned to fluency

Example: 
A young child learns to open a door at their house by turning a door knob. One day, while at a friend’s house, they encounter a door that has a handle rather than a knob. The child is able to turn the handle and open the unfamiliar door. This is an example of response generalization because functional both responses are equal (they open result in the door being opened) but the response topographies are different.
