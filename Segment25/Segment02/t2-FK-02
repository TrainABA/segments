Examples:
In evolutionary history, our ancestors ate certain foods because it had an adaptive value as it helped ensure survival (natural selection of behavior; phylogenic selection).  The food did not necessarily need to be a reinforcer but was necessary for survival.  However, in modern times, we all have food preferences and may eat food that has no nutritional value or health benefits, indicating that specific foods are eaten because of their reinforcing value (ontogenic selection).  This type of eating habit is not adaptive (e.g., think about overeating, binge eating, obesity and the subsequent health problems that can emerge from this type of eating behavior) but it is strengthened and maintained by operant conditioning, thus reflecting selection by consequences (Skinner, 1981). 

Cultural Selection: Pennypacker (1992) provides examples of how selection by consequences is observed in education, economics, and politics and social organization.
