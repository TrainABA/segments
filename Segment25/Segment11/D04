Example: 
A therapist sits across from his student Zeke in the preschool classroom.  The therapist prompts the student to “do this,” and claps her hands.  Zeke responds within two seconds of the therapist’s prompt and claps.  The therapist responds by adding a token to Zeke’s token board.
During job training, the job coach, Flora, demonstrates to her new employee, Fauna, how to turn the copy machine off at the end of the workday.  Fauna then immediately flicks the switch, demonstrating that she understands the expectation.  Flora praises Fauna for paying attention.  

Non-Example: 
A therapist sits across from his student Zeke in the preschool classroom.  The therapist prompts the student to “do this,” and claps her hands.  Zeke does not imitate the model and reinforcement is not delivered.  Later during the day Zeke excitedly claps his hands when his favorite song is playing on the TV.
