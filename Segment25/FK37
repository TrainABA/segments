FK-37 stimulus generalization.

Definition (Stimulus generalization):


 















(Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007). 
Flashcard created			Learned to fluency

Example: 
A child says, “mommy” in the presence of her mother, but also says “mommy” when she sees her grandmother or daycare provider. 

Have supervisee identify the difference between response generalization and stimulus generalization.
Have supervisee identify the difference between stimulus generalization and stimulus discrimination. Have him/her identify the qualities of each and give examples.
Have supervisee give examples from their workplace of stimulus generalization.
