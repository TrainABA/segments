Definition (Unconditioned motivating operations):

Flashcard created			Learned to fluency

Examples:
Roger has not slept in three days because he has been studying for his chemistry final. Sleep becomes more valuable the more deprived of sleep he gets. 

Non-example: 
Roger lost his key to his apartment and cannot get in. The locked door serves as motivation for him to find his key to get into his apartment. The key serves as a reinforcer because his learning history identifies this as the only way to unlock his door and get into his apartment.
