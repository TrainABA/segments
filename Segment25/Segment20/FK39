FK-39 BEHAVIORAL MOMENTUM.

Definition:
Behavioral momentum is defined as “a metaphor to describe a rate of responding and its resistance to change following an alteration in reinforcement conditions” (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007).

“In classical physics, momentum is defined as the product of velocity and mass. Translating metaphorically, behavioral momentum is the product of response rate and resistance to change” (Nevin, 1992, p. 302).

Response rate had been used as the measure of response rate for many years. With the introduction of behavioral momentum, Nevin challenges this and describes resistance to change as a better way to measure response strength. (1974)

There is a common misconception that behavioral momentum is synonymous with the high-p request sequence. According to Nevin, the field should be cautious when describing behavioral momentum this way (Nevin, 1996).

Example: 
“If you are working at the computer, and you keep working even though you are called to dinner that is an example of behavioral momentum” (Pierce & Cheney, 2013, p. 134).

A student is coloring at his desk. The teacher asks him to come down to the rug to listen to a story. He continues to color for a few more seconds.

James is watching TV. His remote stops working. He continues to push the button despite the battery being dead.
