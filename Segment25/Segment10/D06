Example: 
Brad is going to teach show tying to one of his students. He decides to use a forward chain and writes down all the smaller steps involved in tying ones shoes. This successfully and systematically helps his student learn to tie their shoes.

Non-Example: 
Joe decides to use video modeling to help his student learn to tie their shoes. He has them watch the video daily and then model what they learned from that video in an attempt to have them learn how to tie their shoes.
