Example: 
Bill is presented with an array of 3 shapes and his teacher states, “show me the circle”. Bill points to the circle and his teacher tells him he did a great job. 

Non-example:
Bill’s teacher gives him a worksheet on matching shapes to pictures. She tells him to complete the worksheet and then hand it in to her so she can review it.

Related Lessons:
A-01: Measure frequency (i.e., count).
A-02: Measure rate (i.e., count per unit time).
A-07: Measure trials to criterion.
D-03: Use prompts and prompt fading.
E-01: Use interventions based on manipulation of antecedents, such as motivating operations and discriminative stimuli.
E-12: Use errorless learning procedures.
H-01: Select a measurement system to obtain representative data given the dimensions of the behavior and the logistics of observing and recording.
FK-10: Behavior, response, response class.
FK-11: Environment, stimulus, stimulus class
FK-47: Identify the measureable dimensions of behavior (e.g., rate, duration, latency, inter-response time).
