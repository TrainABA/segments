Example: 

In a matching-to-sample trial, “A” is given as the conditional sample and is then presented in a series of five letters “z”, “k”, “a”, “t”, and “b.”  By correctly matching “A” to “a” the learner is discriminating stimuli and selecting the correct comparison that will be reinforced.  The learner’s response will not be reinforced if a stimulus other than “a” is selected.  In this example, the conditional sample “A” reflects the contextual stimulus as it creates a context for which stimulus to discriminate.
