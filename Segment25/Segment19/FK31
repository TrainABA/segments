Example: 
When John has not eaten in a while he asks his caregiver for a snack. When John asks he’s given a snack. In this case the antecedents are food deprivation and the presence of someone who can provide food. The behavior would be the request for a snack and the consequence is being provided with a snack.

Related Lessons:
B-01: Use the dimensions of applied behavior analysis (Baer, Wolf, & Risley, 1968) to evaluate whether interventions are behavior analytic in nature.
E-01: Use interventions based on manipulation of antecedents, such as motivating operations and discriminative stimuli.
G-04: Explain behavioral concepts using nontechnical language.
I-01: Define behavior in observable and measureable terms.
