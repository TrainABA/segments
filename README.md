# Segments
This repository is for managing TrainABA framework for fieldwork hours via Github. 

Why would that matter? TrainABA framework would achieve it's highest level of organization if this concept works. See below.

(i) Supervisors fork the Segments master branch directly from TrainABA, preserving integrity of the official and original information (organized perfectly for the TrainABA system since we do it in-house).

(ii) Now supervisors have the TrainABA framework on their Github accounts. They tell their supervisess to fork the supervisor's repo (NOT TrainABA repo). Now, the supervisor has control of how their supervisees use TrainABA framework. It is customizable to that supervisor's needs. The supervisor's repo is "downstream". I think supervisors should keep it public, but more on that later.

(iii) Supervisors make changes directly to the forked repo on their own Github accounts, to make the content more specific. They change a meeting agenda item here, add/remove a learning objective, fill in the blanks on an item, etc.  

(iv) Since the rest of the team is "following" the supervisor's forked repo, they get emailed with changes as they happen. 

(v) A supervisor may assign something for the supervisee to do, related to the forked repo, such as linking to a learning objective on a TrainABA open source elearning course. The supervisee can add that update to the master meeting agenda by creating a pull request. The supervisor can review it and has total control. They can send a quick note that lines 3-4 need to be changed, for example. If it's perfect, the supervisor merges the pull request into the branch. Now it's in the main supervision repo for the current and future supervision cohorts. This is very helpful in keeping the team organized going forward.

(vi) Over time, you will develop your own specialized training materials for a specific purpose at your company. TrainABA can develop guidelines on this going forward, to make sure it all stays compatible. More on that later. 

### Why public?

Should I make this private or public?
Public! For so many reasons. Do what works for your organization, but consider the pros and cons. Your Github account repos are public by default, which encourages open source development as a community. If public, your colleagues and friends can more readily access the information. They can learn from what you are doing and vice-a-versa. TrainABA can learn from what you are doing, allso. We can help each other as a community. You get better at supervising by doing it more, so with practice we can all help each other out. 

But what about competition? Will other ABA companies steal your ideas and put you out of business? Not at all. You know better than anyone the demand for autism behavior intervention is high now and the bottleneck is quality staff. Demand exceeds supply, which means you are really only competing with yourself to see how many great supervisees you can produce.
