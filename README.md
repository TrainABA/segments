# Overview
The TrainABA Supervision Curriculum Series was published as a copyrighted book in 2015. It was released as an open-source project in 2017, though TrainABA did not have the resources to develop the project beyond free PDF copies and plaintext files. In 2018, the project was adopted by a 501(c)(3) called Cumulative Records Documentation Society (CRDS) and enrolled in its Professional Frameworks Project program.  As part of the program, CRDS has begun the process of converting TrainABA books to a public license for non-commercial use. The TrainABA books are being developed so that anyone will be able to use, copy, modify, and distribute non-commercially. 
Target Outcome 1: Remove and replace content that is not appropriate for a public, non-commercial license.
Target Outcome 2: Every supervisor can customize their own version and distribute it to interns. 
Target Outcome 3: Every professor can customize their own version for students. 

To download the current release, click on "Releases" in this repo. A more user-friendly version of this framework is anticipated in a major release for Fall 2019.  

This repo contains a Moodle course, "TrainABA BCBA Independent Fieldwork Learning Management System (LMS)," for managing 1500 hours of supervision via 2-week curriculum. Free & open source software. Check for current releases, here on this Github page.

### Segments
This repository is for managing TrainABA framework for fieldwork hours via Github. 

Why would that matter? TrainABA framework would achieve it's highest level of organization if this concept works. See below.

(i) Supervisors fork the Segments master branch directly from TrainABA, preserving integrity of the official and original information (organized perfectly for the TrainABA system since we do it in-house).

(ii) Now supervisors have the TrainABA framework on their Github accounts. They tell their supervisess to fork the supervisor's repo (NOT TrainABA repo). Now, the supervisor has control of how their supervisees use TrainABA framework. It is customizable to that supervisor's needs. The supervisor's repo is "downstream". I think supervisors should keep it public, but more on that later.

(iii) Supervisors make changes directly to the forked repo on their own Github accounts, to make the content more specific. They change a meeting agenda item here, add/remove a learning objective, fill in the blanks on an item, etc.  

(iv) Since the rest of the team is "following" the supervisor's forked repo, they get emailed with changes as they happen. 

(v) A supervisor may assign something for the supervisee to do, related to the forked repo, such as linking to a learning objective on a TrainABA open source elearning course. The supervisee can add that update to the master meeting agenda by creating a pull request. The supervisor can review it and has total control. They can send a quick note that lines 3-4 need to be changed, for example. If it's perfect, the supervisor merges the pull request into the branch. Now it's in the main supervision repo for the current and future supervision cohorts. This is very helpful in keeping the team organized going forward.

(vi) Over time, you will develop your own specialized training materials for a specific purpose at your company. TrainABA can develop guidelines on this going forward, to make sure it all stays compatible. More on that later. 

### Why public?

Should I make this private or public?
Public! For so many reasons. Do what works for your organization, but consider the pros and cons. Your Github account repos are public by default, which encourages open source development as a community. If public, your colleagues and friends can more readily access the information. They can learn from what you are doing and vice-a-versa. TrainABA can learn from what you are doing, allso. We can help each other as a community. You get better at supervising by doing it more, so with practice we can all help each other out. 

But what about competition? Will other ABA companies steal your ideas and put you out of business? Not at all. You know better than anyone the demand for autism behavior intervention is high now and the bottleneck is quality staff. Demand exceeds supply, which means you are really only competing with yourself to see how many great supervisees you can produce.
