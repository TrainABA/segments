Examples:
Mary was yelling in class and her teacher became concerned. Since this was usually during group time, the teacher thought that she was yelling to get out of participating in the group. She asked the behavior analyst for the school district to come observe Mary in class and try to figure out what was going on. The behavior analyst observed several times and noticed that Mary only yelled during music based and song activities when it got loud in the group. He decided to allow Mary to functionally ask for noise reducing headphones or a break away from the group while they were singing or listening to music that was loud. After some training, Mary’s yelling decreased significantly as she started using the headphones and functionally communicating during group.
