Examples:
A window does not just randomly bang shut; it bangs shut because a gust of wind has blown it and this has exerted enough force upon the window to close it. 
A water pipe does not just spontaneously burst; it bursts because there is a fault somewhere in the system, which has caused a buildup of water in the pipes, resulting in so much pressure within the system that the pipe has burst.
A client’s self-injurious behavior does not just suddenly decrease after days of high rates of SIB. It decreases because the sensory-blocking procedure that’s in place has begun to extinguish the behavior.
