a-11 Design, plot, and interpret data using a cumulative record to display data

Definition (Cumulative record): 






 




(Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007). 
Flashcard created			Learned to fluency

Example: 
The cumulative record below indicates the number of attributes learned by a first grade student.  The overall response rate is 13 attributes across 181 sessions.  In general, data in this graph suggests that there was a fairly slow rate of acquisition. However, the slope is much steeper between sessions 1 and 61, indicating that the rate of acquisition was quicker during the first part of the intervention.
