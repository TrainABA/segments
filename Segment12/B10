Example: 
An experiment that compares response blocking with and without redirection. 
An experiment that compares differential reinforcement of alternative behavior with and without extinction
An experiment that removes one procedure at a time from a treatment package consisting of three procedures (e.g., Token system, response cost and extinction) and compares responding under each condition to responding during implementation of the full treatment package.
