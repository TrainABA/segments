Example: 
Accuracy: You and a friend decide to go on a 5-mile run.  Your friend tells you that she can monitor the distance because her legs always start to hurt once she runs 5 miles.  You, being a data-driven behavior analyst, decide that your friend’s measurement procedure might not be the most accurate so you use your smart phone app to track the distance.  Your measurement system will likely reveal a better estimate of the true value of the distance you ran.

Reliability: Using the example for accuracy, both measures can be reliable if at the end of the run your friend tells you that you must have run 5 miles because her legs hurt and your app indicates you ran 5 miles.
