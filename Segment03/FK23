Example: 
Automatic Reinforcement: Scratching an insect bite removes an itch; eating food when hungry removes hunger, humming may be auditory reinforcement; nonfunctional movements such as hand flapping may produce a sensation, which is automatically reinforcing; some self-injurious behavior may produce a sensation, which the individual may enjoy.

Automatic punishment: Albert bites his canker sore, causing a shocking pain. Albert is becomes cautious as he eats with his canker sore until the canker disappears.  A dog gets a thorn in his paw. He experiences pain when he steps down on his foot.  He begins to walk on three legs.
