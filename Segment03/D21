Examples:
- DRO: Providing a toy following the absence of inappropriate vocalizations for 5 minutes which decreases inappropriate vocalizations. 

- DRA: Providing a break for handing over a break card which increases the use of the break card in the future. 

-DRI: Providing social attention for having hands in their own pant pockets which subsequently decreases scratching at caregivers hands.

-DRH: A student typically only completes one math worksheet per class period. Providing a break with a preferred item contingent on finishing three math worksheets, which increases the number of worksheets completed by a student. The student only gets the preferred item when they complete three worksheets.

-DRL: Providing attention when a student says “excuse me” 2 times every 10 minutes and not providing attention if the behavior occurs more frequently within that 10 minute period which maintains low rates of the behavior
